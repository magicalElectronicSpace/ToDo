## Developer

This program was made by Sebastian William Descy, who is new to GitHub at the end of 2024.


## Running
You should make a shell script to run it. Write this:

#!/bin/your_sh

/path/to/your/python3 /path/to/your/todo

"Press Control+X to save your work and exit nano, then type this:"

chmod +x /usr/local/bin/todo

todo

It should return a prompt:

This can make a new file. Now you know how to use my ToDo list app!
